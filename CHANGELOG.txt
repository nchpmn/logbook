Version: 1.0.0
Branched the project. Intend to add new module for file handling. Many of the modules are to be rewritten to work properly or nicer, as per new knowledge after digging into the python Docs a bit more.

12:09 PM 9/08/2010
Version: 1.1.0
Removed all old modules, going to recreate them. Started with passCheck.py

1:42 PM 9/08/2010
Version: 1.2.0
Updating newTrip.py along with fileHandling.py. Going to implement a new way to save the log to file.

2:22 PM 9/08/2010
Version: 1.2.1
Still working on newTrip.py, not working perfectly. Problems when saving totals to file. Could move to on-the-fly calculation (for line in file, total += data[13] etc.). Finishing up for now, only minor revision number.

8:40 AM 13/08/2010
Version: 1.2.2
Continuing work on read/write of logbook and totals data.

8:45 AM 13/08/2010
Version: 1.3.0
Completed work on writing log and totals to file, now working on the logviewer module. Major revision number as it is a new module that has been added.

9:11 AM 13/08/2010
Version: 1.3.1
Completed log viewer module, now testing and refining to ensure it works cleanly. Code compared to before branching is much neater and consise.

9:19 AM 13/08/2010
Version: 1.3.2
Finished debugging the viewer module, just the totals one to go. Error handling is required when asking for a trip that isn't in logbook (EOF error)

9:26 AM 13/08/2010
Version: 1.3.3
Finished totals module, only Error Handling and GUI to be completed.

2:21 PM 13/08/2010
Version: 1.4.0
Now to implement Error Handling into the program
