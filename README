|  Welcome to the LEARNER DRIVER LOGBOOK!  |
|                                          |
| Here's what you do. If you'd like the    |
| documentation, head over to the \docs    |
| folder for the Project Planning and the  |
| project's CHANGELOG.                     |
|                                          |
| If you're here to install, there's inst- |
| ructions for that in the \docs folder,   |
| and the files you'll need are in the     |
| \install folder.                         |
|                                          |
| Enjoy!                                   |
