|  Welcome to the LEARNER DRIVER LOGBOOK!  |
|                                          |
| Written in Python, to be used anywhere.  |
| Designed to be used as a replacement for |
| the paper logbook that is used currently |
| by the RTA.                              |
|                                          |
| This project aims to replace that with a |
| fully working and functional alternative |
| that is usable by the less tech-minded   |
| people (the supervising drivers, i.e.    |
| the parents)                             |
|                                          |
| Enjoy!                                   |
